Hi! This is Mygavolt, the dev largely responsible for ATE's complex doctrine and syncretism setup
I'm writing this read me for future devs or enterprising submodders so they know how to set up their faith so syncretism and other doctrine systems function correctly

=============== SYNCRETISM TENETS ===============
In order for faiths with a Syncretism tenet that sets to Astray to function correctly, you need to give that faith its corresponding invisible doctrine
These doctrines can be found in 000_syncretism_related_doctrines, as the syncretism_override_doctrine and americanist_syncretism_variation doctrine sets
Custom faiths made over the course of the game will get these doctrines naturally in the faith_creation on_action - for starting faiths, you need to add them manually
That will look like the following example from Anglican:

doctrine = doctrine_catholic_syncretism
doctrine = catholic_override_doctrine

You will also need to do this with Inter-Faith Services, La Mano de Dios, and Las Veinte Verdades. That will be discussed after the syncretism stuff

This is necessary for the following syncretic tenets:
Catholic Syncretism
Protestant Syncretism
Latter Day Saints Syncretism
Eastern Christian Syncretism
Reawakened Syncretism
Divina Patriota Syncretism
Veteranic Syncretism
Afro-Diasporic Syncretism
Rasta Syncretism

Harmonic Syncretism

Americanist Syncretism IF THE SYNCRETIC FAITH IS ANACHRONOUS, WITH ADDITIONAL STIPULATIONS
Industrialist Syncretism IF THE SYNCRETIC FAITH IS ANACHRONOUS
Capitalist Syncretism IF THE SYNCRETIC FAITH IS ANACHRONOUS,
Idiosyncratic Syncretism IF THE SYNCRETIC FAITH IS ANACHRONOUS
Modernist Syncretism IF THE SYNCRETIC FAITH IS ANACHRONOUS

Trailwalker Syncretism

In addition, Astronomer Syncretism has additional stipulations

### AMERICANIST SYNCRETIC FAITHS
Regardless of whether they have the override doctrine or not, they also need a syncretism variation doctrine
If you want the faith to have the President as their Head of Faith, give them Hail to the Chief and the following line of code:
religious_head = k_presidency

For NON-ANACHRONIST faiths that you want to be "presidential" but not see the President as their Head of Faith, give them Freedom of Religion
Freedom of Religion is redundant to americanist_override_doctrine on Anachronists, so don't give them Freedom of Religion, give them Americana

For faiths you want to be "non-presidential", give them Americana
For Anachronists, if you set things up correctly they will have americanist_override_doctrine alongside special_doctrine_americana
This means their syncretism will be naturally upgraded to Astray rather than Hostile

### CAPITALIST SYNCRETIC FAITHS
Regardless of whether they have the override doctrine or not, they also need a syncretism variation doctrine
These doctrines control what virtues the syncretism tenet 'gives' your faith
If you want them to see Generous as a Virtue (aligning them with the Profit), give them The Rising Tide

If you want them to see Greedy as a Virtue (aligning them against the Profit), give them Greed is Good

If you want them to see Ambitious as a Virtue (neutral alignment), give them Market Rate

### ASTRONOMER SYNCRETIC FAITHS
These doctrines are OPTIONAL. If you do not give your Astronomer Syncretic faith one of these doctrines, they will see all Astronomers equally as Hostile
These doctrines on the front end are loc-wise identical to the Astronomer doctrines. Don't be fooled! they have different internal names
If you want them to be atheistic, give them special_doctrine_atheistic_variation

If you want them to be spiritualistic, give them special_doctrine_spiritualistic_variation

=============== OTHER TENETS ===============
the Inter-Faith Services, La Mano de Dios, and Las Veinte Verdades override doctrines are written in 0000_hostility_groups, in the ifs_override_doctrine_group & hand_of_god_twenty_truths_doctrine_group sets

For faiths with Inter-Faith Services, you need to add the "ifs_override_doctrine" to the faith with IFS
This will render any other doctrine or tenet they have a receptor doctrine, being something for other doctrines to scan for regarding overrides
That will look like the following example from Quaker:

doctrine = tenet_inter_faith_services
doctrine = ifs_override_doctrine

For faiths with La Mano de Dios, you need to add the "hand_of_god_override_doctrine" to the faith with La Mano de Dios
This will mean they always see Peronists as Evil, regardless of any lower-order doctrines below them
That will look like the following example from Heromaquia:

doctrine = tenet_the_hand_of_god
doctrine = hand_of_god_override_doctrine

Similarly, for faiths with Las Veinte Verdades, you need to add the "twenty_truths_override_doctrine" to the faith
This will mean they always see Heroic faiths as Evil, regardless of any lower-order doctrines below them
That will look like the following example from Justicialista:

doctrine = tenet_las_veinte_verdades
doctrine = twenty_truths_override_doctrine 

=============== SPECIAL DOCTRINES ===============
Because of how Enemies of God works, it also requires an override doctrine
For faiths with Enemies of God, you will need to add the "enemies_of_god_override_doctrine" to the faith
That will look like the following example from Church of Satan:

doctrine = special_doctrine_enemies_of_god
doctrine = enemies_of_god_override_doctrine

Industry Trust, a Petrobaron doctrine in the universal set, is unique in that it also uses the Capitalist variation doctrines
