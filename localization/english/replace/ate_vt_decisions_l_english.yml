 vt_redcoat_dominion.1.desc: "Years ago, a colonial party was sent out from the British heartland to survey the lands of the New World. And yet, what they found there was a land of great empires and kingdoms, of technology and culture, and perhaps most importantly — of wealth. After being "personally" notified of the worth of this land by the highest priests of the Glorian creed, her Majesty has declared an invasion of the New World, sending tens of thousands of men to fortify her outpost."
