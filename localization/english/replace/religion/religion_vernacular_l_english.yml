 vernacular_religion_adj: "Vernacular"
 vernacular_religion_adherent: "Vernacular"
 vernacular_religion_adherent_plural: "Vernaculars"
 vernacular_religion_desc: "The Vernacular religion emerged after the [Concept('the_event_ate','Fall')|E], rising out of the ash and rubble of the ruined world. Local conceptions and cultural practices became tenets of faith and slowly developed into entirely new systems of belief. Rituals that once incorporated metaphor took on literal meanings, oral traditions became more authoritative, and the few religious texts remaining garnered strange interpretations. From these 'vernacular' traditions, a new diverse set of faiths have been born."

 revelationist: "Revelationism"
 revelationist_adj: "Revelationist"
 revelationist_adherent: "Revelationist"
 revelationist_adherent_plural: "Revelationists"
 revelationist_desc: "Revelationists believe that when the many forces of Heaven and Hell began the War of Tribulation, the once prosperous Earth was engulfed in spiritual and material chaos. These powerful multitudes fought to a stalemate, and became the powers with dominion over the Earth, calling the dead to become angels or demons to assist their side in the conflict. The faith itself involves delivering fiery sermons regarding divinely revealed concepts and commands which have been given by the forces of heaven. Adherents' nigh-polytheistic reverence for many biblical figures, emphasis of supernatural over textual authority, and integration of snake handling into ceremonies marks them as a distinct folk religion under little more than a veneer of Christianity."

 omenteller_desc: "Crawling out of the hills and hollers of the Appalachians, came the Omentellers. Their prophets spoke the culture, religion, legends, and history of the Appalachians into a new folk tradition. The creed places strong emphasis on fate, divine prophecy, and the fluidity of existence. This is in stark contrast to their animalistic pantheon, made up of enigmatic figures whose inscrutable wills must be determined through esoteric practices. Fate is tested by ceremonial handling of serpents, speaking in tongues, and the interpretation of divine apparitions. The foreboding shelter of their mountain homes acts as the greatest demonstration of the ominous wonder that the Omenteller faithful embrace through their religion."

Believing that Adam and Eve’s original sin plunged humanity into a crude imitation of the pre-Fall Paradise, the faithful atone for this by recreating the splendid wonders of stone that once stood in the Garden of Eden. Atop these glorious structures, their priests deliver scorching condemnations of mankind’s sin, punctuated by human sacrifices. They carry out these dreadful efforts to glorify their reptilian masters and advance the faith’s mission to revive civilization as it was when the earth was young. Marked by literal interpretations of their eclectic oral and textual traditions, Ophiolatrists hope that the magnificent works and unshakable devotion that they have for their gods will earn them grace with the Serpent in the Wilderness when their sinful nature is inevitably judged."

According to the Hearthtenders, it is women, particularly mothers, who the Father has chosen to keep these bonds of kinship sturdy against the onslaught of the Enemy. Empowered by the strength of the Feminine Spirit, it is the sacred duty of women to battle Evil after the inadequacy of man was laid naked. Yet, the faithful do not fight alone, for the Spirit has elevated various paragons of womanhood into angelic service, where they now take action on earth to help the righteous in their struggle to safeguard the Heavenly Family. This maternal fierceness is tempered by hospitality, because it is a woman’s duty to both build and safeguard the hearth, so that there is always a home worth protecting."
