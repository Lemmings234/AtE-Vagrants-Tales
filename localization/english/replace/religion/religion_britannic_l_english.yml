 britannic_religion_desc:1 "The Britannic faiths believe that long ago, all the world was under the hegemony of the Empire, a glorious nation bathed in eternal sunlight and presided over by divine rulers. Unfortunately, the fall of that majestic state came, causing the sun to set for the first time in centuries. The Britannians aim above all else to restore the Empire through devotion to its nigh-forgotten rulers."

 waveruler_desc:0 "Beneath the waves, there is an ancient empire that once spanned the oceans of the globe, Britannia’s Dominion. The Waverulers carry forth the torch of its legacy by worshiping its monarch, the eternal Queen of the Sea, Britannia. Long ago, this great watery Dominion was nearly destroyed when the creeping cold of Antarctica attempted to freeze the seas. Fortunately, by calling forth Her champion, the Iron Angel, the frigid invasion was repulsed and mankind was spared, but at the cost of Britannia's oceanic empire. Now Britannia is a shadow of Herself, only able to protect and give Her bounties to the steadfast peoples of the Falklands. To honor their goddess, the faithful continue to respect Her marine Dominion and pray for the day which Britannia may swell forth to once again rule over all seas of the world to bring peace and prosperity to all mankind. Until then, the faithful wait with stalwart pride in their goddess."

 glorian_desc:0 "The Glorians make offerings to the spirit Albion as well as a roll of glorified monarchs, poets and wizards. God is in His high sphere, but Britannia is ruled by the shadows of the past. Albion is both a cultural hero and embodied representative of the land and its history, founding the countries of Britannia and giving wisdom and knowledge to their princes. Worship is a diverse act that may have rustics make sacrifices to goblins and standing stones while the citizens of the holy towns sing hymns to Albion and his sons on feast days and bonfire nights."

 thelema_desc:0 "Thelema holds that the individual practitioner’s True Will must be empowered and enacted upon the world in order to carry out the Great Work. Beginning first in Britannia, it builds upon older traditions of ceremonial magic and hermetic scholarship to create a new syncretic religion. Thelemites must channel the spirits of the Goetia and invoke the names of gnostic saints in their ceremonies and may also partake in carnal acts as magical rituals."
