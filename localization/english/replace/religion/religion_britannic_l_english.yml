The Britannians aim above all else to restore the Empire through devotion to its nigh-forgotten rulers."

 waveruler_desc:0 "Beneath the waves, there is an ancient empire that once spanned the oceans of the globe, Britannia’s Dominion. The Waverulers carry forth the torch of its legacy by worshiping its monarch, the eternal Queen of the Sea, Britannia. Long ago, this great watery Dominion was nearly destroyed when the creeping cold of Antarctica attempted to freeze the seas. Fortunately, by calling forth Her champion, the Iron Angel, the frigid invasion was repulsed and mankind was spared, but at the cost of Britannia's oceanic empire. Now Britannia is a shadow of Herself, only able to protect and give Her bounties to the steadfast peoples of the Falklands. To honor their goddess, the faithful continue to respect Her marine Dominion and pray for the day which Britannia may swell forth to once again rule over all seas of the world to bring peace and prosperity to all mankind. Until then, the faithful wait with stalwart pride in their goddess."

 glorian_desc:0 "Old Albion fell harder than most, her institutions and cities were completely swallowed in the madness of the Event. By the time the potentates of Britain organized and got back on their feet little was left of the old civilization. In the face of this spiritual vacuum they fell back on the fragments still known and recorded of Old Albion. In those ancient days there were great theologians, mystic-princes, bards that enchanted all of Europe, and ruling over them all was a wise and faultless Virgin Queen who shielded her people from all harm. Rulers and covens of scholar-priests still pay homage to the Prime Minister and the Two High-Houses of Parliament gathered around the empty throne. Many pray for an end to the long interregnum, and the return of the once and future Queen."
