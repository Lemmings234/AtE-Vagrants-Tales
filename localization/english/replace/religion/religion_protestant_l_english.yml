 charismaticism_desc:0 "Neo-Charismatics are not known as such because of their charm, but rather their belief that 'charismata', the gifts of the Holy Spirit, are still available to all believers simply through baptism and faith. Believing themselves to carry the Third Wave of the Holy Spirit beyond traditional Charismatics and Pentecostals, Neo-Charismatics believe in the availability of gifts including the ability to speak in tongues, miraculous healing of the cripples, gifts of prophecy and more events often considered extraordinary. However, they also desire a structural renewal where apostles and prophets will lead the church to the Kingdom of God. This radical push for an Apostolic Renewal against the hierarchy of the Evangelical Convention has lead the Convention to declare these beliefs heretical, but the Neo-Charismatic faith continues to thrive outside the jurisdiction of the Holy Columbian Commonwealth."

Apart from following common evangelical practices, like speaking in tongues or healing by prayer, the Church also adheres to more spectacular customs, such as a heavy emphasis on extraordinary spiritual encounters or the exorcising of demons through deliverance ministries. It claims to be both the one, True Church and the literal Kingdom of God. Embracing the belief that the expansion of its flock and territory will hasten the return of Jesus, Trono Global envisions a future where the world is wholly under its divine rule, awaiting the moment when Christ reclaims His Throne on Earth."

It soon became the dominant faith in much of the Anglophone Caribbean, as its tolerance for both Protestant and Catholic practices allowed it to serve as a unifying force for Christians in the area.

While historically Mennonite communities were divided along degrees of participation with the pre-[Concept('the_event_ate','Event')|E] world, those separations were set aside as their policies of religious tolerance and social cohesion allowed them to unite isolated communities left vulnerable by the collapse."

This mindset sustained a spirit of unity among the Miskito, which continues to this day. United by a synod, Catholic, Protestant and Traditional beliefs came together to bring peace to the region. Believers experience divinity through dreams as well as through spirited discourses on the nature of good, evil, and the human spirit.

The initiative was short-lived, however: During the months of Doctrinarian Debates, the fundamentalist neopentecostal sects assumed control over all key posts of the Assembly and expelled those mainstream denominations which refused to submit to their theology. Shortly after, these rejected groups banded together into the new Assemblies of Christ, which later expanded into other parts of Latin America. While individual churches are nominally independent, they all share a number of core doctrines, like Continuationism - that is, the belief that the gifts of the Holy Spirit, such as speaking in tongues, miraculous healings, blessings and prophetic proclamations, are still available to all those who believe in Jesus Christ as their savior."

However, just as Jesus announced 'I did not come to bring peace but a sword', Templários prepare for battle - both spiritual and literal - against the forces of evil. For the Templários, expanding the dominion of Christian law is paramount, and doing so through militant action it is the only way to completely liberate mankind from demonic control. Their prophecies tell of an apocalyptical Final War between the armies of good and the forces of Satan himself, whose defeat will herald the beginning of the utopian Kingdom of God. However, Jesus himself will only sit on His earthly throne once the faithful construct the new biblical Temple of Solomon upon the New World."

Through inter-faith services, adherents invite members of other faiths into their holy spaces to perform their own rituals, so as to open new pathways to the divine. The Church retains many elements of traditional Protestant Christianity, believing that the Bible is God’s most direct revelation to humankind, and that Communion is a holy act."

As such, they are both moralistic and legalistic, believing that each individual has a responsibility to uphold the principles set down by Moses.

This new 'Sword-Minded' movement holds that the sinful world can no longer be shunned, it must be saved and redeemed. Self-defense is taught to adherents, and warfare is permitted so long as it takes place for righteous reasons. Missionary work is also encouraged, with the movement believing that all mankind must be a part of God’s flock before an age of peace can begin.

This light can be discovered both on an individual and community level, with religious and social decisions being made by holding meetings in which the attendees collectively determine what path God desires them to take.

Hutterites are distinct among the traditional Anabaptist denominations for their doctrine of the community of goods, rejecting the idea of private ownership of property in favor of communal ownership. Each colony, which are largely rural and agricultural in nature, holds all land in common and rather than paying wages to one another, Hutterites share the products of their labor as a collective.
