 modernist_religion_desc:1 "Ultimately deriving its principles from a series of pre-[Concept('the_event_ate','Event')|E] cultural movements, Modernists believe that constant change is necessary for the advancement of humanity: only by continuously defying society's norms may a person and their community be brought to enlightenment. Breaking with tradition and questioning all convention are sacred tasks which may take many different paths, such as novel forms of meditation, the creation of new works of art or even the resistance against tyranny. Modernists hold particular respect for the Old Masters, a pantheon of nearly one hundred sages from [old_brazil|E] whose works, they believe, serve as eternal guides towards incessant change, advancement and reshaping. Most of these faiths survive as minorities within the Empire itself, while others carve out petty realms in the vast expanses of Brazil's interior."

Through an unceasing journey towards enlightenment, self-realization, and continuous questioning of old dogmas, believers gain an ever-deepening understanding of the true potential of everlasting change. Alternative services consist of collective meditation and discussions on the true meaning of those ancient tomes, and how its wisdoms can be applied to the present day."

Each building serves as a testament to the achievements of the men and women of the past, a totem to their legacy, and as a stepping stone for the efforts of the next generation. The path towards enlightenment can be unraveled by combining the erection of new structures with meticulous study of the works of the past - in particular, the revolutionary, almost surreal shapes built under the guidance of Lina, the Master Artisan; Niemeyer, the Master Architect; and Lúcio, the Master Planner."

While he is known for imbuing his wisdom and kindness to worthy leaders, he earned this title for the unconditional love he gives to all of his followers. His children today are called to fulfill his vision of Old Brazil, either by ruling magnaminously or supporting those worthy to rule unconditionally."

Since no single faith or culture encapsulates all possible truths, true enlightenment necessitates firsthand exploration of the peoples, rituals and legends of this land. Followers constantly seek inspiration and meaning from their sacred book "Macunaíma", which recounts the fantastical odyssey of a flawed hero across [old_brazil|E], and whose enigmatic verses have baffled translators and theologians for centuries. While some scholars assert that the imperfect protagonist symbolizes Brazil itself, others delve deeper, believing that profound secrets of transcendence lie concealed within the cryptic layers of this ancient narrative."
