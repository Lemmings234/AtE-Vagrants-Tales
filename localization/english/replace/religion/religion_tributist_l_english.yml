tributist_religion_adherent_plural:0 "Tributists"
tributist_religion_desc:0 "While most of the Abrahamic religions believe demons and other malevolent forces to be an ultimate and absolute evil, the sects derisively referred to as ‘Tributist’ have a more practical approach. They believe that the appeasement and assistance of dark forces is a necessary part of life on Earth, and that cavorting with them does not taint the heart with sin. This fundamental disagreement on the nature of the demonic caused these groups to slowly but firmly peel away from mainstream Christendom into their own loose Abrahamic sect."

archipelagic_adherent_plural:0 "Archipelagics"
archipelagic_desc:0 "Within the Communities of the Archipelagic Rites, there exists an uneasy truce. The ruling class and the clergy are loyal to the Patriarca of the Animist Catholic Church. Despite the persistent warnings of heresy from the Animist priests, however, the peasantry are known to seek the services of the Brujos - men of magic who command fear and respect from the common folk. In exchange for wealth, sheep, or family members, the Brujos perform their supernatural rituals. While the entrenched ecclesiarchy in Santiago may warn against such dangerous rituals, the clergy in the region turn a blind eye, preferring to ignore these traditions over eliminating them outright."

 santa_diablada_adherent_plural:0 "Santos Endiablados"
 santa_diablada_desc:0 "Born from a clash between worlds, Las Santas Diabladas are a diverse and vibrant clade of beliefs that have arisen in the Central Andes. Santos Endiablos believe that wide pantheons of powerful beings composed of Saints and Demons exist below God the Father. Whether due to awe and admiration or abject fear, these Saints and Demons must be worshiped and kept content. Otherwise, they may swing from blessing their followers into cursing those who refuse to give them the offerings they seek and deserve. Just as these two sides have clashed against each one another since creation, so too do their followers hold their rivals in contempt, maintaining the same struggle that has existed between Heaven and Hell since the beginning of time itself. The leading members of the saintly pantheon are Jesús, the Virgin, San Ernesto and El Tata; the demonic pantheon is composed of powerful beings such as El Tío, Ekeko, Momo and Mandinga, amongst many others."
