 #haudenosaunee_religion_desc:0 "The Haudenosaunee people originated as a confederation formed through the actions of Hiawatha, Skennenrahawi, and Jigonhsasee; a leader, seer, and female leader respectively. Their work led to the creation of the 'Great Law of Peace' by Skennenrahawi, the great peacemaker and seer. These laws formed the basis of Haudenosaunee society for hundreds of years. Upon encountering Europeans, divisions within this society formed between those who integrated with the Europeans and adopted Christianity, the traditionalists, and those who adapted their faith and religion to counter European influence."

 gaiwiio_desc:0 "The Longhouse religion or Gai'wiio, meaning 'good message', was founded by the Seneca prophet Handsome Lake in 1799.

Twice a year, the Gai'wiio is publicly proclaimed in an elaborate ceremony resembling Christian revival meetings."

 niionkwarihotens_desc:0 "Niionkwarihó:tens - 'our ways' - is a term used to denote the hybrid reconstructed-traditional pre-contact belief system of the Haudenosaunee. While he had many different names, the Haudenosaunee believe that the Great Spirit, who is the chief of a pantheon of deity figures, was born with an evil twin, who killed their mother during his birth. Various other spirits inhabit the natural world and are responsible for everything from good harvests to natural disasters. The Great Law of Peace, established by the Great Peacemaker and his spokesman Hiawatha, codified a social constitution for the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, including rites, rituals, and ceremony. This includes practices of housing spirits inside masks, in order to protect households from evil."
