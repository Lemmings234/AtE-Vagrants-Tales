These viticultural faiths conduct rituals under intense holy intoxication, believing that the reduction of inhibition makes one more connected to the divine."

 vendimia_sol_desc:0 "Evolving from the harvest festivals of western Argentina, the worshipers of the Sun, beauty and the ecstatic hedonism of Dionysian-esque rituals have carved themselves a unique niche in the spiritual landscape of the Southern Cone. An all-female priesthood, said to be the brides of the Sun, serves as the organizer and host of great banquets meant to celebrate his gifts. However, centuries of vilification and persecution by both Anachronists and Christians have given this faith a deeply fundamentalist outlook, believing themselves to be the last ones chosen by the Sun himself."

The Celebrants of the Life-Giving Sun see these shared beliefs and experiences as proof of the unifying power of the Father of Light, the Sun of May, and His demigod children. Having blessed the land of Argentina with incomparable bounty, He ordered His sons to defend the people as Heroes and His daughters to lead the people as Queens, and for the people to cherish His gifts - an order the Celebrants strive to follow each day."

 unidad_basica_desc:0 "The mountains of Argentina occupy a special place for the disparate Peronist traditions of Argentina, but for the Unidades Básicas, they are even greater - they are the place where Perón became whole. The region had been torn asunder by the wrath of El Tigre, and Perón, then still a man, came to assist the survivors. It was there in the rubble that he met The Solar Queen, his divine half - Evita. She embraced him, and Her radiant light mended the earth and the people who bore witness. Revering Evita as a goddess, Sufragistas seek to uphold the work which She has done for their nation by assisting their community, devoting themselves to one another as Evita devoted herself to the motherland."
