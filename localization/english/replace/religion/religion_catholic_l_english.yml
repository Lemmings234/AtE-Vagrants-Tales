The new American Popes lacked a permanent temporal seat for over a century - a period known as "the Wandering Papacy" - until control over the city of St. Louis in Missouri was finally achieved. With this newfound authority came a gradual solidification of power, with many formerly independent churches of varying denominations entering communion with the Papacy for various reasons; their traditions being subsumed in the process."

While the Particularists have maintained their Catholic Latin rites, traditional folk practices of the River Plate Basin have deeply permeated it.

The Ursulines uphold the position that none of the Christian bishops currently operating in the Americas have proper apostolic succession, making them invalid. However, members of sanctioned religious orders can serve as de facto clergy until contact with the true Papacy is re-established."

Only the Cahíta were blessed by Liós and his spirits to understand existence, as they know what it means to live straddling two different worlds. These blessed truths call the faithful to harmonize with the many layers of the universe through dance and prayer. Though the beliefs of this world are varied and diverse, all legends lead to one truth; the Cahíta have always understood this."

In closed-off communities, unmarried men, referred to as "fathers" by their flock, secretly perform sacraments while outwardly participating in the rites of their Satanic overlords. The faithful hold mass clandestinely where they clutch disguised rosaries made from conchs and carved wood, praying quietly for Jesus to deliver them from the demons which surround them. The most valuable possessions of these communities are the remnants of church relics and icons that have managed to survive the pagan onslaught, physical evidence of a past where Rome, lost across the ocean, reigned supreme."

Openly embracing the syncretic traditions of popular Catholicism and the Afro-Brazilian faiths, the liturgy of the Santeiros often evolve into colorful public processions, incorporating drumming and songs in the sacred Portuguese and Yoruba languages. Believers also put great importance on the worship of the Christian saints, who are often conflated with the orixás of Candomblé, allowing for many rites and sacraments to be shared by both faiths. The main ceremonies of the Santeiros are the yearly festivals in praise of the Virgin Mary, also honored as the orixá Iemanjá, a series of celebrations led by the Patriarch of Salvador himself."

These first truth came from Jesus, who warned that God had decided to punish the natives for their sinful ways, their drunkeness, and their hubris. The second truth came from Mary, offering a second chance through Besiko's stewardship. This new covenant was sealed over an ancient flag, a relic once borne by now forgotten gods who had protected the green zone that was America. Under the rule of Besiko, the divine message proclaimed, the Church was to be abolished, and the meek would serve as wardens of the new law forevermore."

The gauchos, dressed in red, dance tirelessly, performing a dignified sapucai shout in honor of Antonio Gil, the patron saint of active and repentant criminals. The Giles have prayed to Gauchito Gil for many generations, beseeching their flawed yet honest hero to guide them through life's hardships. Despite his imperfections, Antonio Gil found God in his final moments, where he was given the power to do good, and in a selfless act proving his redemption, he healed the child of his executioner. The movement is mainly comprised of hardened rural gauchos and farmers, who understand that as long as they pray and pay homage to Antonio Gil through his many shrines, they will be granted the same mercy he received, and will reach heaven."

 catholic_charismatic_desc:0 "The Charismatic Renewalist Movement has roots in the antediluvian Catholic Charismatic Renewal Movement, which drew from the far-strayed Protestant flock to propose several reformist arguments in order to grow the church. They strongly believe that Charismata, or, Gifts of the Holy Spirit—such as the gifts of tongues, healing, prophecy, and others—have persisted into the modern era. Laypeople are supposed to have a more active role in the church, along with maintaining and nurturing a 'personal relationship with Jesus'. While existing at the margins of Catholicism in the Americas today, the Church's faithful continue to practice their unusual approach to Catholicism in many areas."

 traiteur_desc:0 "Surviving for centuries despite oppression and adversity, Traiteurists believe that the tribulations delivered upon mankind, be it through pestilence or desolation, purify the souls of the faithful and bring them closer to their Lord through His grace. In reward for their endurance, God grants believers the natural bounties of the Earth as a refuge. Named after their method for treating and cleansing the souls of the suffering with prayer and local herbs called "traitement", traiteurs and traiteuses fulfill the spiritual needs of their community. These skilled healers administer the seven sacraments and absolve the sins of the sick through traitement so that they may go directly to Heaven. Additionally, many folk beliefs have been integrated into the faith's canon, such as Jesus being born in Acadia and the veneration of the Archangel Gabriel Lajeunesse."
