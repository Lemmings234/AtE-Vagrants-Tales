 concentric_religion_desc:1 "After the Lifeless Night, the island of Svalbard was left entirely alone. By some impossible miracle, people still survive on the barren rock. The religion of those hardy souls is known as Idunnic, after a nearly forgotten goddess of a lost country. These faiths hold life as extremely sacred, and death as an unnatural corruption of their cold world that must be resisted at all costs."

 earthvault_desc:0 "Upon the harsh and frigid Svalbard, life is precious and fragile. Only the most resilient of organisms can survive in the tundra. It is the dedication of the Earthvaulters to preserve what life they can in case of an unprecedented extinction. This is achieved primarily through the storage of seeds and plants in underground vaults and specially constructed gardens. As it is told by the Earthvaulters there was once a time of lifelessness, the legendary figure Julenisse and his Nisse servants delivered seeds across the world, and that in some future time, the Earthvaulters would need to take up the mantle of Julenisse and with the aid of the remaining Nisse, spread life across the world again."
