He planted the first seeds in the fertile primordial soils of the earth in the form of several great Queens, one for each kind of plant and animal, and granted them the laws by which they would grow and diversify. Since then, the laws have demanded the bloodlines of the Lineage Queens engage in fierce competition, absorbing the genetic mana they need to prosper from other living beings who walk the earth, including ones of your own kind. Those individuals who obtain the most of this genetic mana become Naturally Selected, and their essence shall be infused into them and all of their children."
