 medicine_religion_desc:0 "Medicine refers to the practices of Indigenous spiritual healing, leadership, and rituals used by various tribes in North America. The religions which carry these practices into the post-[Concept('the_event_ate','Event')|E] world often carefully cherish them and limit the contact which outsiders have with the details of their traditions. Secret societies or lodges are organized and maintained within Medicine religion for these purposes."
 
 midewiwin_desc:0 "Midewiwin, or the "Spiritual Mystery", is the traditional religion of many Native American groups in the Great Lakes area and beyond. Followers of Midewiwin believe that the [Concept('the_event_ate','Event')|E], or the "Seventh Fire", marked the start of a new era for Native Americans across North America, a time for reclamation of both land and spirituality. The center of Midewiwin practice is the "medicine lodge", where initiated priests conduct rites of ceremony and passage for their people."
