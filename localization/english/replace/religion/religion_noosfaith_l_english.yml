nousthreskeia_desc:0 "The central tenet of Nousthreskeia is the concept of the \"Noosphere\", an invisible field that surrounds the Earth and is affected by the collective thoughts and feelings of humanity. Followers of Nousthreskeia believe that the Noosphere is capable of altering both the collective human consciousness and physical reality itself, and that the Event was the result of artificial interference with the Noosphere. This interference damaged the Noosphere, knocking the physical world and the consciousness of humanity back to a more primitive state. Nousthrestkeists believe that humanity will not recover from the Event until this damage to the Noosphere has been healed and that a \"Wish Granter\" exists somewhere in the world that can accomplish this goal almost instantaneously if used properly."
