 mormon_religion_adherent:0 "Latter Day Saint"
 mormon_religion_adherent_plural:0 "Latter Day Saints"
 mormon_religion_desc:0 "The Latter Day Saints movement is a Christian tradition hailing from New York in Old America, based on the teachings of Joseph Smith. The founder and prophet of the movement, Smith received his revelations from the Angel Moroni, who gave him the golden plates which contained the Book of Mormon. In it, a new testament of Jesus Christ was revealed, containing the lost history of the American continent. Unusual doctrines, such as the belief that the Godhead is composed of three distinct entities or concepts such as exaltation have led to LDS denominations being seen as distinct from their Nicene brethren."

Though it was founded in New York, the early followers of Smith were forced to flee steadily west to escape persecution. After Smith himself was killed by an angry mob, those who saw Brigham Young as his successor followed the church even further to the land now known as Utah. By far the largest LDS denomination prior to the [Concept('the_event_ate','Event')|E], the church believes they have restored the gospel of Christ in the time before the Second Coming and positions itself as the last bastion of Christendom west of the Rockies."

 woolleyite_adj:0 "Fundamentalist"
 woolleyite_adherent:0 "Fundamentalist"
 woolleyite_adherent_plural:0 "Fundamentalists"
 woolleyite_desc:0 "The Fundamentalist Churches are ancient branchs of the LDS movement who splintered from the mainstream over the doctrine of plural marriage. While the first three presidents of Joseph Smith’s church, including Smith himself, practiced plural marriage, the doctrine was advised against and later forbidden as the church established itself in Utah. Various religious leaders rejected this doctrinal change as invalid, declaring that the main church had succumbed to societal pressures to conform. Fundamentalists live in small isolationist communities to avoid persecution from authorities, strengthening social ties for individual wards and branches but making coordination between groups difficult."

 strangite_desc:0 "The Strangites are a tiny sect descended from the lineage of James Strang, who alleged that prophetic succession from Joseph Smith required divine appointment. Having received that appointment from an angel, Strang, as “King” of the church, introduced new scripture to accompany the Book of Mormon, including plates from an ancient American king and the Book of the Law of the Lord. Strang incorporated new doctrines as well, such as animal sacrifices during religious festivals, and maintained older ones like plural marriage. Strang died without a clear successor, leaving his church rudderless and doomed to obscurity. Those who still remain no longer proselytize, but they do accept those souls who come to them."

 lamanite_desc:0 "Followers of the Prophet Joseph Smith have existed in Latin America for centuries. Lamanites firmly believe that the events described in the Book of Mormon happened in Mesoamerica, and that their ancestors were intimately involved with the events described in it. Lamanites cling tightly to their heritage, incorporating it into the structure of the foreign faith; their worship mixes traditional Mormon practice with the veneration of ancestors and exalted figures who were mistaken for gods in the distant past. An ancient prophecy holds that the Lamanites "shall blossom as a rose", and they are keen to see its fulfillment."

 bickertonite_desc:0 "The Church of Jesus Christ is the sole heir to the Rigdonite denomination of the LDS movement, regarding Sydney Rigdon as the true heir to the presidency instead of Brigham Young. The original Rigdonite church collapsed soon after relocating to Pennsylvania, but William Bickerton would revive it after leaving the mainstream church over its then-in-effect doctrine of plural marriage. The Bickertonites consider Joseph Smith to have been translator and president only, not a prophet. As a result, they reject many of the unique doctrines of other Latter Day Saints churches, including plural marriage, and while Bickertonites reject the Trinity like the Brighamites, they believe that the Father and Son are distinct, with the Holy Spirit a mind shared between them."

Reorganites believe that Smith’s son, Joseph Smith III was the proper heir, remaining in the midwest while the followers of Brigham Young traveled west. Though the Community of Christ preserves some of the unique aspects of the LDS movement, such as continuous revelation, they have rejected others like nontrinitarianism and plural marriage, meaning that the denomination enjoys much smoother relations with Nicene Christian creeds compared to other mainstream LDS churches. Other beliefs more distinct to the Reorganites are the ordination of women to the priesthood and a strong emphasis on achieving earthly peace."

Equating Providence with the God of the Book of Mormon, Patriots see the President as the prophet of the divine in the lineage of Joseph Smith.
