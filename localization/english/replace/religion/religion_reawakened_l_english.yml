 reawakened_religion_desc:1 "The Reawakened are a broad category of Christian faiths who seek to forge an identity independent of the Catholic-Protestant divide which dominated religion in the Americas prior to the [Concept('the_event_ate','Event')|E]. So named for the truths revealed to their founders, the Reawakened realize that the Event was but one of many confirmations that the old churches had lost their ways and that Christianity needed to be set back upon the righteous path as the world inched ever closer to Armageddon - though what exactly that righteous path is can vary wildly between denominations."

 christian_science_desc:0 "When Mary Baker Eddy was near death, she read from her Bible an account of Jesus’ healings, and was herself healed. In this moment, she realized the truth - that injury and illness were no match for the all-power and all-love of God, and that sin and error had no place in God’s creation. The practices she had rediscovered were codified in the textbook Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures, and the Christian Scientist movement was born. Believing that material reality itself is an illusion born of error and that humanity is a spiritual reflection of God, Christian Scientists seek to heal themselves of the errors they believe result in disease and injury, and continued misguided belief in material existence in order to achieve atonement with God."

The societies of the old world, who could transform the face of the world to service their needs, built great cities and other works of engineering which were to serve as the foundations of God’s Kingdom on Earth. However, Babylon invaded and corrupted the hearts of the Builders, who turned from God’s path and destroyed one another’s works. Intending to restart God’s plan which was delayed by the [Concept('the_event_ate','Event')|E], the Society for a New Jerusalem models itself, in a literal and figurative sense, after the Old World, emulating their governance and their architecture in a bid to restore the Kingdom and usher in the world to come."

Unlike their Catholic precursors, the church preaches that the godhead consists of five persons, a Quinternity of the Father, the Son, the Holy Spirit, the Mother (Mary), and the Daughter (Marie Paule’s current reincarnation on earth, who is revered as God). Proclaiming that the [Concept('the_event_ate','Deluge')|E] brought about the age of the Daughter, they teach that a new church which is truly open to the perpetual revelation of God in the person of Christ as Woman (or in other words, of their current leader) must ultimately supplant the Church God founded in Rome. Denouncing the corruption of the Ursuline order, the faithful march out from Quebec to bring the good news to the rest of the world. "

They regard themselves as the new chosen people of God, residing in the land given to them by the Almighty in the West like Israel was given to Moses' people in the East. Likewise, Ezequiel is considered the Christ of the West, the reincarnation of the Christ of the East, Jesus of the New Testament. The Inca built Machu Picchu and their kingdom with the aid of God in ther Holy Land of the East, but the people strayed from God's commandments and became separated from Him. The New Universal Pact is a restoration of the covenant God made with His people - Israelites therefore keep to all of the laws described in Leviticus, wearing only clothes described in the Bible and growing their hair and beards long. They believe that God will soon come to judge mankind, but He will spare the people of privileged Peru and grant heaven on earth to those who remain steadfast in their faith."

Adherents believe that they are the adopted descendants of the Twelve Tribes of Israel and thus strongly emphasize Judaic elements of Christianity. The faithful also acknowledge the existence of spirits, especially those of deceased ancestors, who may do both good and evil at the beckoning of 'obeah' holy men and women. These entities sit beneath God the Father in a hierarchy of celestial and terrestrial spirits, alongside Mother Earth and various Hindu deities, a theological order similar to other Kongo-influenced cosmologies such as Kumina or Palo."

 swedenborgian_adherent_plural:0 "Swedenborgians"
 swedenborgian_desc:0 "Swedenborgianism is a small but influential church tradition stemming from the theological teachings of pre-event mystic Emmanuel Swedenborg. The New Church, they claim, is the restored church of Jesus Christ, who was the incarnate Jehovah. Specifically, they believe that Jesus progressed towards Jehovah during his life by gradually making his human body one with divinity, putting it as "the Lord's Human is Divine". Love and charity, coupled with acknowledgment of the Lord, provide the pathway to salvation and union with Jesus. Indeed, some of the most famous American folk heroes are claimed as believers by the Swedenborgians; however, they are often treated harshly by other Christians for their occultic practices and their rejection of the Trinity as three persons in one."

 jesuist_desc:0 "The Jesuist Movement seeks to re-establish the original religious movement of Jesus of Nazareth as they understand it. Believing that Jesus was a wise and admirable spiritual leader, the faith seeks to distance itself from other Christians who see him as part of the supernatural Godhead. Instead, they use their own scripture, which contains Jesus’ words and teachings, but no miracles. This peculiar theology wins them few friends among the rest of Christianity and the faithful in turn see the Nicene and Trinitarian traditions as coming from a corrupted account of Jesus devised by Paul, who they reject as a false prophet. While predominantly deistic, the movement has consistent internal debates over the nature of Jesus and his message; it is also averse to iconographic worship, instead preferring austere ceremonies. The faithful maintain humility and restraint, in order to live as Jesus did."
