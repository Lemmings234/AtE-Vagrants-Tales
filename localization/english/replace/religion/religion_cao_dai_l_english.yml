 cao_dai_religion_desc:1 "Caodaism is an Eastern religion founded before the [Concept('the_event_ate','Event')|E], which draws from various millenarian traditions of Asia. Cao Dai - the Jade Emperor - is said to have revealed himself to various prophets across time, including figures like Jesus, Moses, Muhammad and others. The uninitiated might incorrectly assume the trappings of the religion resemble those of the Catholic Church, but in fact this structure is the earthly manifestation of his Heavenly Court on Earth. Outside the Cao Dai and his prophets, a large canon of saints and wise warriors that fought behind the All-Compassionate Radiance are also recognized, such as Joan d'Arc, Marx, and Victor Hugo. In the times since the Event, the faithful have come to believe that era of Redemption will soon be realized through the renewal of this world."

 cao_dai_desc:0 "Originating from across the Pacific, the Church of the Third Universal Redemption stems from the myriad of traditions found across East Asia which have since intermingled with the faiths found throughout California. Founded by Ngô Văn Chiêu after he recieved a revelation from Cao Dai, the All-Compassionate Jade Emperor, the religion prospered for a time. However, a great struggle in their homeland saw the faithful scattered across the world. Upon the separation of believers from the Ancestral Holy See after the [Concept('the_event_ate','Event')|E], those living in California consolidated within the Court of Heavenly Reason. Influenced by one of Ngô Văn Chiêu’s disciples, Bách Điều Hòa, female clergy members form the heart of the Church across the West Coast, where they make it their mission to not only teach the revelation of Cao Dai, but also to redeem the masses in the example of their shining Lord."
