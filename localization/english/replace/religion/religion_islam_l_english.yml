Regardless of sect or creed, Muslims dedicate themselves to living a good life in servitude to the one and only merciful God, as defined by the teachings of the prophet Muhammad."

They further advocated the use of personal Ijtihad, meaning "religious interpretation", rather than relying exclusively on the opinions of scholars and teachers."

When the [Concept('the_event_ate','Event')|E] came and shattered society, the Order’s commitment to charity and community did not change. The Shriners subsequently took on a leadership role in the communities they held the most sway in, gaining respect and reverence among the people. As they grew, the Shriners embraced the symbols and titles they once used merely out of tradition as their new identity. From this evolution, a cosmopolitan and exotic form of Islam began to take shape. The Order of the Mystic Shrine accepts anyone who is willing to devote themselves to charity and the teachings of the Prophet, often garnering respect of both unbelieving rulers and masses alike due to their noble commitments."

Drawing from several sources of Islamic jurisprudence in order to interpret the divine law, the cosmopolitan nature of Tajdeed also leads them to the wisdom of the Great Masters of [old_brazil|E], whose words they employ both as commentary to the Quran and the Sunnah, as well as guides to more esoteric forms of worship and self-knowledge."

In addition, Kebatinan Muslims also venerate a variety of spirits who they see as assisting God."

In punishment for this betrayal, Allah initiated the Event to destroy world civilization. Although the Imam of the Age now guides from heaven, believers prepare for the day when the Antichrist will bring tyranny onto the world before being defeated by the Mahdi and Jesus as they return to Earth from Heaven.  Although encouraging the spread of the faith, practictioners reject participating in the society ruled by non-believers, declaring the rule of infidels to be inherently tyrannical. The Tawwabin believe it is obligatory to strictly adhere to all facets of Islamic law and to entrust governance to those who will uphold it while preparing for the rise of the Antichrist. Practice of ritual self-flagellation with chains and swords is common to spiritually connect themselves with the suffering of Hussein and Muhammad al-Mahdi at Karbala."

Seeing the celebration as a force of unity, Hosaynis incorporate the diverse influences of the traditions of the Caribbean into their celebrations. However, Hosay is also viewed as a reminder that just as Hussain did, the dispossessed and oppressed should rise up to overthrow tyrants, even if it may cost them dearly."
