Various Islamic communities have adapted to the world after the Event in many different ways, sometimes straying quite far from original Islamic theology. Regardless of sect or creed, Muslims dedicate themselves to living a good life in servitude to the one and only merciful God, as defined by the teachings of the prophet Muhammad."

They further advocated the use of personal Ijtihad, meaning "religious interpretation", rather than relying exclusively on the opinions of scholars and teachers."

 abbasiyya_desc:2 "The Abbasiyya School is a post-[Concept('the_event_ate','Event')|E] Sufi Order that descends from a variety of Indian Sufi orders combining their doctrines with the pluralist attitudes of California. They strongly encourage interfaith services and missionary outreach to create what is in their words, a Universal Sufi Brotherhood. They encourage communal chanting of the names of God and meditation on God's light, which fills all of mankind and lifts their souls to God. The goal of these meditations is to embrace the ultimate light of God and allow your ego to be evaporated by it. The Abbasiyya sect emphasizes striving to embrace God and follow both the inner practices of concentration and meditation, without ignoring the outer practices of living a godly life by strictly adhering to their moral code and purification standards. While their doctrine discourages aggression, they see physical resistance against tyranny as a laudable goal, especially when done by one who has destroyed their ego and become filled entirely with the light of God."

Adopting the trappings of rulers from far off lands and using similar titles in their organization, they were wholly committed to charitable work and giving to their communities. When the [Concept('the_event_ate','Event')|E] came and shattered society, the Order’s commitment to charity and community did not change. The Shriners subsequently took on a leadership role in the communities they held the most sway in, gaining respect and reverence among the people. As they grew, the Shriners embraced the symbols and titles they once used merely out of tradition as their new identity. From this evolution, a cosmopolitan and exotic form of Islam began to take shape. The Order of the Mystic Shrine accepts anyone who is willing to devote themselves to charity and the teachings of the Prophet, often garnering respect of both unbelieving rulers and masses alike due to their noble commitments."

Drawing from several sources of Islamic jurisprudence in order to interpret the divine law, the cosmopolitan nature of Tajdeed also leads them to the wisdom of the Great Masters of [old_brazil|E], whose words they employ both as commentary to the Quran and the Sunnah, as well as guides to more esoteric forms of worship and self-knowledge."

 kebatinan_desc:0 "Kebatinan is a form of Islam that evolved initially in Java out of a focus on Sufi inwardness, while also incorporating Hindu and Javanese traditions. Eventually, the faith made its way to the Guyanas. Kebatinan Muslims emphasize an inner, individual focus to spirituality, believing that every person has a unique personal relationship with God, which is cultivated through inward practices that emphasize their soul’s connection to God. In addition, Kebatinan Muslims also venerate a variety of spirits who they see as assisting God."

Specific emphasis is given to the Four Ladies of Heaven and the role which they played in Islam's birth."
