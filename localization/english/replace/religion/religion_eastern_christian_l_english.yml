Instead, God has to be found within a person, with the help of elders and community gatherings in which there is communal celebration and prayer."

For centuries, they primarily made their homes in the regions of Old Canada's far western lands; however, at some point after the [Concept('the_event_ate','Deluge')|E], a tranformation occurred within the ethos of the community, and the Freedomite sect, itself an echo of an old movement, emerged triumphant in the hearts and minds of the Doukhobor villages and settlements."
