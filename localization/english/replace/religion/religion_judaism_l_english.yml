 judaism_religion_desc:0 "Judaism is the oldest of the Abrahamic religions, and it survived the [Concept('the_event_ate','Event')|E] as it did so many other catastrophes. The uniting thread of Judaism is the belief in a single, undivided God, who appeared to Abraham, Issac, and Jacob. These three patriarchs are, in turn, the spiritual ancestors of the Jewish people, whose unique covenant with God compels them to live by His laws and teachings."

 haredi_adherent:0 "Haredi"
 haredi_adherent_plural:0 "Haredim"
 haredi_desc:0 "Haredim are the successors of the most traditional pre-[Concept('the_event_ate','Event')|E] communities, who banded together and accepted many other Jews into their ranks during the chaos after the Event. Although there is a great deal of diversity in Haredi religious practice, they are united in their anticipation of Moshiach, or the Jewish Messiah. Haredim believe that Moshiach's arrival will be accompanied by the return of the Jewish people to Eretz Yisrael and the ushering in of peace on earth. In the meantime, Haredim fastiduiously study and adhere to Halakha, or Jewish religious law, believing that this will facilitate Moshiach's imminent arrival. Haredim are notable for their tendency to limit participation with the culture of outsiders, although they do not go out of their way to antagonize non-Jews or otherwise interfere with their lives."

 reform_adherent_plural:0 "Reform Jews"
 reform_desc:0 "Reform Judaism emerged well before the [Concept('the_event_ate','Event')|E], and its ideas have persisted in Jewish communities across the centuries. Reform Jews believe that Halakha, or Jewish religious law, is non-binding, allowing every Jew to autonomously interpret and practice Judaism as they see fit. As such, the vast majority of Reform Jews openly ignore halakhic rules regarding gender roles and sexual norms; women are regularly ordained as rabbis and same-sex weddings are routinely conducted. Reform Jews do not universally believe in the imminent arrival of Moshiach, and are instead devoted to the principle of Tikkun Olam, or repair of the world. This principle holds that each Reform Jew must work to restore the pre-Event world through collective effort and force of will, with special attention paid to eliminating social inequality."

Meshichists believe that the last great pre-Event Haredi Rebbe is actually Moshiach, or the Jewish Messiah. The notion of a centuries-dead man being Moshiach appears to contradict most Jewish teachings on the subject, but Meshichists reconcile this by claiming that the Rebbe is still "alive" in a metaphorical and spiritual sense and that he will one day complete his duties and usher in an age of peace on Earth. Meshichists place a great deal of importance on the more mystical and esoteric aspects of Jewish religious practice, but this is coupled with a fastidious study of Halakha that is typical of traditional Judaism."

 edah_amazonah_desc:0 "Judaism first arrived in the Amazon basin long before the [Concept('the_event_ate','Event')|E], brought by migrants from a land called "Almagri". After centuries of isolation from the rest of the Jewish world, the Amazonian community, or "Edah Amazonah", has developed an idiosyncratic form of Jewish religious belief and practice. Amazonian Jews believe that having a spiritual connection with God's creation - in particular, with the great rainforest that they have called home for centuries - is just as important as having an intellectual understanding of God's laws. Amazonian Jews also make no effort to isolate themselves from non-Jewish society, as the harsh environment of the Amazon would make any such effort impractical at best. This has caused their own forms of worship to be influenced by those of their neighbors."

However, some of these Jews continued to secretly adhere to Jewish beliefs and rituals, and often sought to evade detection by traveling to the farthest-flung reaches of these empires. Today, only the memories of the old empires remain, and the descendants of the coerced Jews - the Anussim - are free to once again practice Judaism openly. They believe that most of the inhabitants of the Americas are also descendants of Jews, although many have forgotten their heritage, and as such encourage the lost members of their tribe to return to the ancient faith."

 kadmonic_desc:0 "Judaism is often noted for its ability to maintain tradition over the course of countless tribulations. Yet some among the faith identified the need for spiritual evolution. Tracing itself to the teaching of the pre-[Concept('the_event_ate','Event')|E] wiseman Reb Zalman, the Harmonious Renewal looks inside and outside Jewish tradition to find a path for a new age. These Renewal Jews focus foremost on the shared wisdom which all religious traditions can provide, adopting and sharing outside practices in equal measure. Primarily concerned with mysticism, especially Kabbalah, the faith also utilizes psychedelics to enhance their connection with the divine. This sharing of traditionally secretive rituals makes them controversial to some other Jewish faiths, yet for the Renewal Jews, it is a small price to pay for greater harmony and cooperation among all peoples."

From forty years in the desert to the shtetls of the Pale of Settlement, their history has made them well prepared for the challenges of the Pampas, a harsh region that demands hard work and endurance from those who wish to survive its vast plains. These "B'nai Beis" embrace their long lineage of pastoralism as one of their key strengths. Turning inwards, the faith relies on the bonds of their villages, the constant willingness to lend a hand or defend their neighbors in need. However, this introversion is not unfriendliness or fear of the outside world. The faithful refuse to bend to any outside oppression, while always remembering that the Talmud teaches that “greater is hospitality than receiving the Divine Presence,” an unflinching kindness in a hostile land."

However, the most important aspect of their tradition is its preservation - a responsibility which falls primarily to the mothers of the next generation. Not only are they responsible for raising future members of the faith, but it is also their duty to instill in them the values and traditions which underpin the Shorashim. Perhaps the greatest lesson that will be passed down to the inheritors of this ancient heritage is the simple phrase "Am Yisrael Chai" - the people of Israel live."
