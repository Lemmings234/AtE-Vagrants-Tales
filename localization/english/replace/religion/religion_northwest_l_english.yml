 northwest_religion_adherent_plural:1 "Northwesterners"
 northwest_religion_desc:1 "The Northwestern Indigenous faiths draw their spirituality from the breathtaking natural environment of the Pacific Northwest. Often placing central importance on the wildlife of the region, especially salmon, the Northwestern faiths emphasize connection or stewardship of the land and the creatures which inhabit it alongside humanity. Additionally, these faiths often overlap with local cultural practices, such as potlatches or totem-raisings. Since the [Concept('the_event_ate','Event')|E], these faiths rarely face pressure to assimilate into wider hegemonies, instead they have once again become the influential and dominant ascendancies themselves."

 raven_tales_desc:0 "Followers of the Raven Tales revere supernatural beings described in their sacred stories, Raven foremost among them. In some tales Raven is playful and benevolent, while in others he is greedy, treacherous, and wanton. He is sometimes loved and sometimes feared. Raven indirectly made the world by stealing and transforming that which came before, and preserved the Haida though the Dark Times with cleverness and trickery. Other Xhúuyee K'iigaang gods include Ta'xet and Tia, who rule over violent and peaceful death respectively." #copied from ck2, now slightly modified for flow

 waashat_desc:0 "The Dreamers encompass the traditional beliefs of much of the interior Northwest. Over time, their beliefs have evolved while still retaining major core elements, including respect for the natural world and the spiritual power of dreams. Prophetic dreamers, such as the ancient Smohalla, serve an important role in introducing and recodifying rituals and stories for new generations. Adherents place great importance on honoring traditional ways of life, as well as the spiritual link between humanity and the creatures and plants Mother Earth has provided, and the other spirits of the land."
