In pre-[Concept('the_event_ate','Event')|E] times, the great warrior-sage Sepé Tiaraju successfully defended his people against scores of foreign invaders. He was eventually killed in battle, but his body was never found. Followers of Sepé Morangatu - the Holy Sepé - proclaim that he ascended to the heavens, where he watches over and guides the faithful. Followers seek to emulate the good character of Sepé Tiaraju and the customs of his time, such as sharing all farming land among the community and pledging to defend the oppressed against wicked tyrants. Sepé Tiaraju is also venerated as a folk saint by the surrounding Christian populations, which guarantees warm relations with the neighboring Particularist and Celeste churches."
