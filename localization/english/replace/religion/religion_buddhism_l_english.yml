 buddhism_religion_desc:0 "Buddhism originated three thousand years ago in the far off land of India, where it was taught by a sage known as Siddhartha Gautama of the Shakya clan. Upon attaining enlightenment, he took the title of "the Buddha", the enlightened one, and began to spread his message. The core teachings of Buddhism revolve around the four noble truths -that birth, life, and death lead to suffering; that the origin of this is craving; that by giving up craving one is released from suffering and rebirth; and that the means of attaining this is the noble eightfold path, a set of ethical and moral tenets."

The followers of Shangrilaism call themselves Spiritual Warriors and undertake a rigorous regimen of ethical, social, and meditational practice to ensure their fitness in society. The faithful are trained to be non-agressive and engage in contemplative behavior, but the doctrine emphasizes the ability to defend oneself with force if necessary. They believe in a natural hierarchy where all are interconnected and interdependent and accept their place within that hierarchy. This organization of reality is conceptualized as a mandala around the Universal Buddha Samantrabadhra, who is surrounded by the Buddhas and their emanations. As part of their spiritual practice, they engage in ritual use of marijuana, datura, and peyote to induce a meditative state which aids in the visualization of mandalas, helping practitioners understand the luminous and boundless nature of the universe."

As such, they see Buddhism as having a mission to build and foster a variety of social and communal services, works done for the good of all beings. These efforts are believed to contribute to the collective enlightenment of humanity. While monks focus principally on spiritual development through mindfulness, they also cultivate compassion through conversations with lay people and assistance to those in need. Lay members themselves cultivate spiritual merit through volunteer work, donations, and personal kindness."

Believing in a distant creator God who empowered bodhisattvas such as Buddha and Moses to spread the laws of order and reality, these Lotusians honor the primacy of this singular creator and their rules, but do not shun those who wish to venerate any figure in either religion's canon. Additionally, the details of the precepts which a member of the sect is expected to follow tend to vary, and there is little shame among members in admitting that finding Enlightenment is a journey unique to each individual."

One such example of these fusions is the Great Spirit Path of Dharma, a mixture of Amerindian and Buddhist beliefs. Adherents focus on their religion as a manifestation of respect and reverence. This includes the Buddha, who is viewed as being a wise elder worthy of the same respect as a grandparent, but also extends to the land itself. The faith itself is organized via lodges, which generally act autonomously, but tend to share very similar beliefs and practices. Often a minority, the Great Spirit Path nonetheless has found a place for itself in the diverse landscape of the post-Event West."

 beatzen_desc:0 "Based on Zen Buddhist traditions, merged with the influential philosophy of pre-[Concept('the_event_ate','Event')|E] sages known as “Beatniks”, the Beatzen movement seeks nothing short of complete liberation. The faithful must break both the cycle of rebirth known as Samsara, as well as the earthly structures of oppression known as the Combine. To do this, adherents engage in ritualized usage of psychedelics and marijuana in order to cultivate their senses, so that they may expand their consciousness beyond the limits imposed by Suffering. Additionally, the faith spreads the enlightenment of the Buddha using songs, hymns, and chants, and often incorporates these into meditation. Eschewing monasticism, Beatzen emphasizes the lessons which any person can learn, regardless of their lifestyle, from the Buddha or his various bodhisattvas. Instead, the faithful focus on the experiences of the laypeople, embracing the need to open your home and heart to strangers of all kinds."
