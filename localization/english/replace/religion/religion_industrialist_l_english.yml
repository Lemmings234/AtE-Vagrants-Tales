 industrialist_religion_desc:1 "In the Industrialist cosmology, there are many [natural_forces|E] in the world, though the force of [industry|E] is unique in that it can be forged by the actions of humanity into a powerful divine being. When humanity and Industry worked together, miraculous feats were accomplished. This culminated during the [gilded_age|E], a utopian period of universal prosperity and accomplishment. But when humanity grew lax in its devotion, Industry was weakened and could no longer sustain the society mankind had created. The [Concept('the_event_ate','Great Rusting')|E] ruined that once great civilization and brought an end to the Gilded Age. Now, the faithful seek to restore Industry to godhood and usher in a new Gilded Age."

Each of their Unions emphasizes one of those Titans that shared the Regulations of [industry|E] with mankind. While each Union has its own unique practices, the Reforged Union is undeniably the most unique. Greatly influenced by their Jewish neighbors, this Union is dedicated to the Maker alone, denying the divinity of the Titans altogether. Additionally, this Union is focused on the idea of "reforging the world," an effort to recreate the world of the Gilded Age. By restoring the great works littered across the landscape to their pre-Event glory and refining society to purge unjust impurities, they believe they may uplift humanity back to the Maker's light."
