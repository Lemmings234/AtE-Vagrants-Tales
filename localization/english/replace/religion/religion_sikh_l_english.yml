 sikhism:0 "Khalsa Panth"
 sikhism_adj:0 "Khalsa Sikh"
 sikhism_adherent:0 "Khalsa Sikh"
 sikhism_adherent_plural:0 "Khalsa Sikhs"
 sikhism_desc:0 "The Khalsa Panth is a faith from ancient lands across the ocean. The faithful worship the supreme god, Wahe Guru, who is both a creator and within everything. Khalsa Sikhs follow the ten Gurus and the eternal Guru, the book called the Guru Granth Sahib, which gives praise to Wahe Guru in his many names and lays out the way of life for a Khalsapanthi. To a Khalsa Sikh, it is not simply belief that defines their religion, but practice. All Khalsa Sikh men wear their hair uncut, carry a comb and a sword, and wear an iron bracelet and turban. Furthermore, they all follow the four provisions which state that they must not cut their hair, use intoxicants, eat slow-bled meat, or commit adultery. By doing these things, living a pious life in praise of Wahe Guru, and then meditating on his mystery, Khalsa Sikhs believe they will be united with him."

 ravidassia_adj:0 "Ravidassia"

 ravidassia_adherent_plural:0 "Ravidassias"
 ravidassia_desc:0 "Ravidas Panth, also known as Ravidassia, is a faith stemming from the same faraway lands as Khalsa Panth. Ravidassias believe that the holy man Ravidas was a guru, while in traditional Khalsa Sikhism he is merely recognized as a bhagat, which is a lower position than guru. Many Ravidassias still follow the ten Gurus of Khalsa Sikhism, but give the highest reverence to the teachings and writings of Ravidas. Ravidas taught many similar concepts when it came to the metaphysical world and humanity’s relationship with the divine (which he called Harr), but distinguished himself by rejecting man-made divisions of humankind and envisioning a world where class and property are abolished and all people are equal. Additionally, Ravidassia believes that gurus can still arise, unlike Khalsa Sikhs, who believe guruship ended with the establishment of the Guru Granth Sahib."
