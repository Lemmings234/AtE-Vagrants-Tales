For the Atlanteans, however, there are more. These esoteric religions revere the great mythic civilizations of the past, believing their chosen precursor to have possessed a spiritual and physical truth that greatly exceeded that of even the nations from after the First Ruination which other groups routinely attempt to emulate. Unsurprisingly, exactly what these lost empires once were varies massively between sects. Now, in the modern day, the various faiths of the Atlantean tradition devote themselves to dealing with a world that has forgotten its true history."

Now charged with giving true enlightenment to all the people of the world under the old banner of Atlantis, the Rai commands great spiritual and temporal authority over the Phylosians. This rule may prove tenuous, as the ancient Maxim-Stone proclaims a challenger must supplant the Rai should he ever falter."

Quetzalcoatl, the God-King of Aztlán during the First Ruination of the Fourth Sun, fled across the sea with the few remaining survivors, and founded the advanced Aztec civilization. He established the [toltecayotl|E] to ensure the survival of Atlantean knowledge. The Second Ruination was the end of the Fifth Sun, after the Fifth Sun Huītzilōpōchtli is murdered by the Tzitzimitl, destroying humanity with a massive earthquake. Quetzalcoatl restores humanity by killing Mictlantecuhtli, becoming the Sixth Sun in the process. Everyday worship mainly revolves around the worship of God-King Quetzalcoatl as Sun God and inheritor of Aztlán, with various other polytheistic Aztec deities worshipped alongside him. The intended goal of practictioners is to establish the Sixth Root Race, La raza cósmica, in order to establish a new advanced civilization with the esoteric knowledge of Aztlán and the Aztec Empire."

 egyptology_desc:0 "The fall of the great Atlantis, while tragic, did leave behind an heir to their civilization which would become a rival to their profound majesty and heavily influence the progress of the Americas. This society was Egypt. This lost nation serves as the spiritual basis for the Egyptologists, who seek to regain its cosmic power and to recreate their grand pyramids. The movement focuses its worship around the sun god Ra’s divine knowledge and destinies which He and other celestial beings have given to humanity across history, attempting to use this enlightenment to act as stewards of Egypt’s legacy. The faithful also try to decode the scriptures of other religions, unlocking hidden meanings and revealing the truth that Egyptian civilization is actually the root of all cultures and faiths across the world. Once the truth of Egyptian ascendancy is revealed, a new age of spiritual and technological mastery will begin again."

In the wake of the collapse of both previous attempts at reaching perfection, the Land of Oz and antique America respectively, the Ozymandians defy probability and dream of finally attaining Utopia. The faithful believe that every glorious society is guided by a collection of spiritual principles and celestial forces known as Oz, and that by internalizing the meaning of these concepts a people can be guided in building Utopia on Earth. This sweeping vision involves not only the equality of men and women, but also the shared harmony of all in society. Believers refuse to integrate with the unguided nations, although they have no qualms with bringing the power of Civilization against Barbarism when it is deemed necessary. To the Ozymandians, there is no cost or adversity too great to prevent the creation of their true emerald Utopia."
