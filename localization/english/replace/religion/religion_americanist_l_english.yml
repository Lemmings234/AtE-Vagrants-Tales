 americanist_religion_adherent_plural:1 "Americanists"
 americanist_religion_desc:1 "Americanists believe that the ancient United States was a land uniquely blessed by Providence, a country where every man was free from want, fear and all treachery or tyranny. This prosperity stemmed from the people's belief in the American Dream, which ensured that America stayed on the path of prosperity and liberty. However, that Dream was forsaken by the people of the past, for the America of today is a shadow of its former self; a mere memory of a memory. Yet America can never truly die, and those who still believe in the Dream diligently work towards the day when Providence will once again grant America life, liberty and happiness."

 constitutionalist_adj:0 "Constitutionalist"
 constitutionalist_adherent:0 "Constitutionalist"
 constitutionalist_adherent_plural:0 "Constitutionalists"
 constitutionalist_desc:0 "Constitutionalists believe that America’s Founders were divine agents of Providence who spoke in its stead to deliver the most sacred law of the Constitution to the people. Life and Liberty are maintained by ensuring that laws and actions conform with the original intent of Providence and the precise text of the Constitution. Fittingly, their jurisprudence is defined by an almost obsessive preoccupation with rendering decisions according to judicial precedent and the precise text of the Constitution. The relative rigidity and predictability of this Constitutionalist dogma has created a legal corpus that is excessively obscure and complex, even by the standards of other Americanists."

 principlist_desc:0 "Principlists believe that America’s Founders were divine agents of Providence who possessed perfect moral and spiritual judgment, and that the sacred Constitution, even while reflecting this judgment, can be corrupted by ignorant or malicious misinterpretation. Applying the moral principles of Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness to modern life is the only way to maintain the American Dream; blindly conforming to the text of the Constitution can lead to the very tyranny it is supposed to prevent. As such, Principlist judgements adhere far less closely to the text of the Constitution and allow judges to break with precedent whenever it is needed to ensure a "just" outcome; this flexible but inconsistent approach is popular with the peasantry but disliked by the aristocracy."

 libertarian_desc:0 "The Children of Liberty break from mainstream Americanist thought by proclaiming Lady Liberty as the sole righteous divinity, with the Founders as prophets of her message. Monolatrists, Libertarians expound that Liberty and all her aspects reign above all others as the highest law in the land. Lady Liberty is the Torch-bearer whose shining light enables anyone to prosper in the land of opportunity, to break one’s chains and achieve one’s desires with equal opportunity. Long welcoming the downtrodden with her open arms, Libertarians emphasize that only through providential Liberty does the American Dream become within reach. Due to their denial of the Founders’ full divinity, Libertarians occupy the fringes of what most Americanists would consider their religious brethren."

The Founders, Providence and the abstract "Spirit of America" fill their followers with great determination and can bring them equally great success no matter the odds. However, the confidence of Imaginerians must not be mistaken for foolishness – they are perfectly aware that not every venture can end in material success. However, the truly devoted will find unexpected rewards in everything they do; Providence never leaves a dreamer unrewarded."

Yeomen believe that every American has sovereign rights and privileges under the Common Law and that the President’s claimed spiritual authority is a sham designed to subjugate the strength of the People to the whims of a single man; as a result, Yeomen do not possess any kind of central religious structure and detest those who attempt to impose one on them."

 mayflower_desc:0 "Unlike most Americanists, the Mayflower Society believe in a dualist cosmology - Providence, embodied in the Spirit of 76, represents all that is good, while Tyranny’s evil is equal in measure. When the Pilgrims took their first steps off of the Mayflower, America was born as a land of pure freedom, but over time Tyranny grew within the nation like a cancerous wound. Eventually, Tyranny overthrew Old America in the [Concept('the_event_ate','Event')|E], permanently mixing its evil into the land.\nMayflowers reject the modern institutions and trappings of Americanism, given that positions like the Presidency cannot exist in a reality tainted by Tyranny, and instead assert those institutions will be restored when Tyranny is finally defeated and the universe is purified. To accomplish this goal, the Mayflower Society emulate the Pilgrims and their freedom-loving ways, inviting the Spirit of 76 to fortify their souls against tyrannical corruption."
