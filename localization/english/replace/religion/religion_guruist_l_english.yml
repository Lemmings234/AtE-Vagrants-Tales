 cetic_adherent_plural:0 "Sahasrarans"
 cetic_desc:0 "When the Empire of California united after spending centuries as warring states, the First Emperor found it necessary to unite the disparate people underneath a common spirituality. Drawing from the rich pantheistic culture of the West, he established a system of Gurus, in which all the spiritual leaders that contributed to the Californian religious ecosystem would be revered equally, with one notable exception: the Emperor himself. Taking the position of the Living Guru, the metaphorical crown chakra of the empire, spiritual power was vested in the bloodline of the First Emperor. A powerful cult of personality around the Emperor now dominates Imperial Spirituality. At his command, he has the authority to declare new interpretations regarding all spiritual matters, regardless of the teachings of prior Gurus. Of course, there is always the danger of the cult collapsing once there is no more personality to fuel it."

 anahata_desc:0 "Forming from opposition to the centralization under the Emperor of California and the bickering of his lordly vassals, Anahata serves to protect the weak and powerless. While recognising the Living Guru's spiritual power, they reject his absolute authority. Similarly, they reject the tyranny of the Imperial Bureaucracy, as well as the warlords which succeeded it, preferring instead to place religious authority directly in the hands general populace. Anahata still reveres the Sahasrara Gurus, but also gives special devotion to a series of "Sages" - Guru-like figures who achieved great victories for the common people during their lives. The lessons of the Sages guide Anahata’s thirst for justice and freedom, be it peacefully, or violently."

 manipura_desc:0 "Passed down through ancient lineages of master and student, the practitioners of this ancient art are famed across the world for their prowess and skill. While outsiders are quick to praise them for their physical feats, the masters of these ancient schools know that training the body is only half of what it takes to become a true Master. Even more importantly, one must harness and train their Qi -  the vital force found in every living thing, channeled through the Manipura Chakra. Through the manipulation and use of Qi, one can accomplish mystical feats far surpassing anything training of the body alone can do.  But with these great powers comes great responsibility. The greatest fight the masters face is not against any foe, but the fight against temptation. There is no greater evil than to use Qi selfishly and to oppress the weak."
